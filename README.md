# Java-Lab-004

* In this lab, edit/add/update the given code to complete all parts.

## Part 1: SimpleMethod.java
* Add a method square() to SimpleMethod.java that takes a single argument and prints the result of squaring its integer parameter.

## Part 2: SimpleMethod2.java
* In SimpleMethod2.java, expand the square function to return the result of the square as type int
* In the main class use *System.out* and *Scanner* to request the integer argument you'll pass to the square method.
* Store the result from square in an integer variable in main and print the result.

## Part 3: SimpleMethod3.java
* Modify SimpleMethod3's square methods to use *Math.pow* instead of simple multiplying the numbers yourself.
* Complete both the *integer* and the *double* square functions, this is called method overloading!

## Part 4: Radians.java
* Write a method called *toRadians* that converts *degrees* to *radians* without using the Java Math library.
    * HINT: degrees = radians * 180 / PI
* Write a method called *toDegrees* that converts *radians* to *degrees* without using the Java Math library.
    * HINT: radians = degrees * PI / 180
* In the main function, compare your method's results to the Math.toRadians and Math.toDegrees methods by printing to the console. 

## Part 5 - Submission
* Create a feature branch (i.e. Spring2023)
* Commit your working code
* Push it to your Remote/origin branch (i.e. GitHub)
* Then issue a Pull request to the instructor branch
    * Make sure to save the Pull request URL and submit it for the lab.
